# trojanhorse
A Trojan horse, often shortened to "trojan," is a type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate or benign program to deceive users into executing it. Once activated, a trojan typically performs malicious actions without the user's knowledge or consent, aiming to compromise the security of the target system.

# Python3 Trojan Horse

## Description

The Python3 Trojan Horse is a type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate or benign Python script to deceive users into executing it. Once activated, the Trojan horse performs malicious actions without the user's knowledge or consent, aiming to compromise the security of the target system.

### Features

- Deceptive appearance as a harmless Python script
- Delivery of malicious payload upon execution
- Persistence mechanisms for continued operation
- Remote control capabilities for manipulating the compromised system
- Techniques to evade detection by antivirus and security software

## Installation

To install and deploy the Python3 Trojan Horse, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sabarishh4ck3r/trojanhorse.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd trojanhorse`
3. Customize the Trojan horse script to fit your specific requirements and malicious intent
4. Transfer the modified script to target systems through social engineering or other means

## Usage

To use the Python3 Trojan Horse, follow these steps:

1. Execute the Trojan horse script on the target system: `python3 trojan.py`
2. Monitor the compromised system remotely using the provided command and control (C2C) interface
3. Issue commands to the compromised system to perform malicious actions or exfiltrate data

### Example
1. python3 trojanhorse.py


## Security Considerations

Running a Trojan horse for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical. This software should only be used for educational and research purposes or in authorized red team exercises.
