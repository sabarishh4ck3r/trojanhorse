# trojanhorse
A Trojan horse, often shortened to "trojan," is a type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate or benign program to deceive users into executing it. Once activated, a trojan typically performs malicious actions without the user's knowledge or consent, aiming to compromise the security of the target system.
